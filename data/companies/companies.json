        "\nIt all began in 2008 with an article in the Harvard Business Review announcing that the American government agreed to provide financial support for the complete computerization of medical clinics. Elias Farah and Patrick Issid, both aeronautic engineers, saw a business opportunity. From their analysis they immediately concluded that the majority of medical clinics were weighed down by paperwork and administrative procedures and were in desperate need of smart, effective and reliable tools. Both men recognized that their engineering experience could be applied to the healthcare field by transposing technological advances in the aeronautic industry to the healthcare network. They decided at that point to found MEDFAR International.  They began working alongside four doctors to guide the development of the program.\nIn 2013, the two entrepreneurs succeeded in bringing their project to life by receiving licensing from the Ministère de la Santé et des Services Sociaux for MYLE, the first web-based EMR in Quebec. Three years later, MEDFAR won the majority of public calls for tenders in the province and was implemented in several medical clinics, making MYLE the most used EMR in Quebec since 2016.\nToday, with more than 12,000 users and three medical committees that consolidate 23 doctors across the continent, MEDFAR continues to put all its energy into integrating the latest innovative technologies within MYLE so they can offer healthcare teams and their patients the tools they deserve. \n",
