This will require support at every level of leadership, from our teachers in the classroom, to the highest-ranking officials. Teach For Armenia aims to accomplish this vision by recruiting promising leaders, both in Armenia and from across the diaspora, to teach for a 2-year commitment in schools where their knowledge and skills are needed. In the long-run, our organization is cultivating a network of changemakers, inclusive of our students, their communities, our Alumni, government officials, community partners, supporters, and affiliates from across",

It will be important for Program Design Managers to collaborate closely with one another when determining how to distribute responsibilities in order to maximize the respective teammate’s strengths. The Program Design Managers will also work alongside the Leadership Pathways Manager, who is responsible for developing programming specifically for the organization’s Alumni-Ambassadors (i.e. Teacher-Leaders who have completed the two-year program).

            "ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT",
            "Despite the economic growth of the last decade, the level of food insecurity has been stagnant over the past five years in Armenia. Although the situation is improving for a large share of the population, those worst off are being left behind, demonstrating significant disparities and uneven territorial development in Armenia. In response to these challenges, WFP Armenia Country Strategic Plan (CSP) 2019 – 2024, building on past and current experience gathered in the implementation on its flagship activity since 2010 namely, the school feeding programme, foresees significant strategic investment in the establishment of a comprehensive and strategic response to food insecurity, malnutrition and poverty. The four main pillars of WFP’s CSP 2019 – 2024 will be the continuation of its school feeding programme with a clear handover strategy for a full ownership of the programme by the Government of Armenia by 2023; the establishment of effective and sustainable, nutrition sensitive food value chains; support the Government in tackling malnutrition; and in providing emergency food assistance related to COVID19 and to populations affected by the NK conflict. Capacity strengthening will be a cross-cutting effort at all level and will be key to ensure sustainability of the programmes and activities. Part of the capacity strengthening support included joint work with agencies like UNICEF and UNDP to support beneficiary registration and establishment of a food bank within the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. The emergency food assistance and support to food insecure displaced and Armenian populations were coordinated closely with the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the United Social Services and the municipalities. The many food security assessments and the WFP beneficiary feedback mechanism showed that due to COVID-19 and the conflict, people had become increasingly food insecure and were using negative coping mechanisms. To mitigate from deterioration of people’sfood and nutrition security situations, shock responsive social safetynets can be put in place, or the current social safetynet platforms can include food security indicators so as to include food insecure populations in a national system. Other types of support can be provided as technical support to the Government for designing short and medium type support programmes from a food and nutrition security lens. WFP Armenia, is establishing a new unit for social protection aiming at working with the government to strengthen national systems from a food and nutrition security lens and provide capacity support. The programme policy officer will be responsible for liaising directly with the Government to identify needs, formulate a road map of support and coordinate the support from WFP.",
